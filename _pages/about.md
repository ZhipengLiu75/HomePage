I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the College of Software, Northeastern University, China, co-supervised by [Prof. Bin Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangbin12/) and [Assoc. Prof. Peibo Duan](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/sakuragiduan/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests include time series analysis, graph neural networks, and their applications in artificial intelligence.
